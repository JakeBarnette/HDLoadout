# HDLoadout
Loadout Randomizer :)

Randomizer for Helldivers 2 loadouts that I wrote to try and make the game more enjoyable for me and my friends.

Needs updates as game developes and balances are made.

Generates a random loadout that is then loosely evaluated to see if the loadout will be viable against different degrees
of missions.

Has customizable parameters for generation, a new graphical icon display, as well as an overall "meta" evalutation as of V0.2
